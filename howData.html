            <h2 class="subtittle">How Data Player Works?</h2>
            <p>At first glance you will see a candlestick with the tittle of EURUSD, and a counter indicating 99 Candlesticks.</p>
    
            <p>Also in left side there are a few inputs, and two sliders in the bottom of the screen;</p>
    
            <p>But What’s going on with all this stuff?</p>
    
            <p>Data player has the function of reproduce price movements of the Forex currencies in only one candlestick simply by press the play button.</p>
    
            <p>The tittle pair indicates the currency pair that is currently loaded.</p>
    
            <p>When you press play button you will see how the EURSD prices go until the last price given by <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co" target="_blank" >Alpha Vantage</a></p> 
    
            <p>You can change the pair using the Pair selectors “From” and “To”, and then press the submit button to load the candlesticks related to the pair selected.</p>
    
            <p>Each frame of the movement is formed by default with close prices of 60 min interval, but you can change this interval using the Time Frame selector and then pressing the submit button.</p>
    
            <p>The counter indicates the number of prices loaded to animate our candlestick, by default 100 prices are going to load, but if you want more history prices you can check on the Full Data Size box before clicking the submit button.</p>
    
            <p>
                Also you will see a slider moving on, that represents the point where the data goes.
                You can drag the slider wherever you want to reproduce a specific part of the whole movement.
            </p>
    
            <p>By checking the Full data size checkbox the API will return the full-length time series.</p>
    
            <p>The smaller slider is for the speed, it controls how many time each frame will hold down before the next price starts to show.</p>
